# data_science_foundations
This repository is a collection of data science foundational concepts.  
As part of ongoing professional development and a way to synthesize learning, from my master's of Data Analytics program, 
I am working through foundational data science concepts in R.
The projects include prompts from tutorials, school assignments, and or my own projects.
