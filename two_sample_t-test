#t test general

#H0 = mu1 - mu2 = 0
#HA = mu1 - mu2 not equal to 0


#interpreation of results- the p-value, 9.056 e -11, is below the significance level of .05.  We reject the null hypothesis and can conclude there is a significant difference between the groups.  Children in the study tended to stack more of one type of block.

#change hypothesis to more cube blocks stacked, one sided
#H0 = mu1 - mu2 = 0
#HA = mu1 - mu2 < 0

#interpretation of results - the p-value is beloiw a significance level of .05.  We reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that more cube blocks were stacked.

#test hypothesis that 2 more cubical blocks are stacked
#H0 = mu1 - mu2 = 0
#HA = mu1 - mu2 < 2

t.test(Number ~ Shape, data = blocks,

#interpreation - the p-value is below .05, we reject the null hypothesis, There were at least 2 more cube blocks stacked than cylinder.

#visually, group b responds slightly faster than group A, the spread of data is similar

#t test, equal variance, pooled t-test

#interpreation - the p-value is below .05, we reject the null hypothesis, there is significance difference between the groups

# notes on t-tests
#paired t- test = related sample set
# equal variance = 1. sample set the same size or 2. sample set have the same variance
#unequal variance = sasmple sets do not have the same variance
# two types of pooled test-  when the variances of the two populations are equal (the pooled test) and the other one is used when the variances of the two populations are unequal (the unpooled test)
